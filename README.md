# c-sharp-shuffling-array-01
Here's an example of a C# Windows Console Application that randomizes the array you provided and ensures each member is listed exactly once:

### Explanation:
* Array Initialization: The array ranges contains the ranges you provided.
* List Conversion: The array is converted into a List<string> for easier manipulation.
* Shuffling Algorithm: The Shuffle method uses the Fisher-Yates algorithm for efficient randomization.
* Output: The randomized ranges are printed one by one.
* Wait for Exit: The program waits for the user to press a key before closing.
### How to Run:
* Open Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
* Create a new Console Application project.
* Replace the default Program.cs file content with the above code.
* Run the application to see the randomized output.
